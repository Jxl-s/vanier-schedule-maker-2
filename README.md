A very quick fix of [vanier-courses-api](https://github.com/Jxl-s/vanier-courses-api), uses javascript as a backend instead (due to cheaper costs and easier deployment), and does not get courses in real-time due to new format

## Side-note

In `/src/courses`, I provided an example on how to reverse-engineer the API which Vanier uses for courses, which
could be used to make a real-time schedule maker.

If anyone would like to use that code, feel free, as long as you
give proper credits to this repository. I am not planning on implementing it onto this project due to limitations by Vercel.
